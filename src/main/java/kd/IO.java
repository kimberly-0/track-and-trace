 * <h2>COVID-19 track and trace system</h2>
 * The system will record and manage data via a command line interface.
 * The data is recorded for the purpose of tracing and alerting people who

 * The program enables an engineer to record and manage data about Events,
 * Establishments and Users.
 *
 * The IO class manages the input and output of the program, i.e. the command
 * line interface menus, the user's response, and the printed results.
